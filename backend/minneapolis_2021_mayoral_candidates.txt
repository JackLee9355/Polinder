- Housing is a right. Every single person in our city deserves a safe place to call home
- To address racial disparities in income, wealth, and employment, we need to launch new targeted investment and development policies that prioritize small business owners and workers of color.
- Everyday we must seize the opportunity to tackle climate change, grow our economy, and invest in inclusive outcomes. 
- Economic inclusion starts with business owners and their employees â€“ especially small businesses rooted in their communities.
- We should commit to the data in creating a fully-funded sustainable, and effective community safety system that reflects our values.

- Every person in Minneapolis deserves to feel safe in their home, and in our city regardless of race, gender, sexuality, income, zip code, or level of ability.
- We must develop a new and better public safety system that values the life and safety of all people.
- We must dismantle systems of white supremacy that perpetuate harm towards Black, brown, and Indigenous people, immigrant and LGBTQ communities, and women.
- We must promote environmental justice and health by investing in communities that bear disproportionate impacts of pollution and toxins.
- Our streets should make it safe and comfortable for everyone to get around, no matter how they choose to do so.
